# ZcurveDB
The Z-curve Database is a comprehensive visual database of more than 200,000 genomes. It allows browsing the Z-curve and all its variants for any region of a genomic sequence through an embedded Z-curve Plotter, with free adjustment of smoothness. In addition, it provides a visualization of coding sequence features based on Z-curve parameters (generated by the Z-curve Encoder) and can be used for simple sequence coding capability analysis (deciding whether a sequence has the potential to encode a protein in a species).
## Home Page
The home page provides information and statistics on the overall situation of the Z-curve Database. For the convenience of retrieval, we divide the database into two types: main database and sub-database. The former stores data in units of complete genomes, currently including 6 modules: **Bacteria**, **Archaea**, **Fungi**, **Plants**, **Animals**, **Viruses**; the latter stores sequences of extra-chromosomal genetic elements or special genetic elements, such as **Plasmids**.
