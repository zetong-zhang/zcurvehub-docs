# ZcurveHub API and Help Documentation (Lastest 1.6.0)
ZcurveHub is a "Software-Server-Database" system developed by **T**ianjin **U**niversity **B**io**I**nformatics **C**enter (**TUBIC**), aimming to build a comprehensive, one-stop Bioinformatics platform designed to streamline nucleic acid sequence analysis through the mathematical framework of the Z-curve theory. It empowers researchers to extract DNA/RNA structural features, identify functional genomic elements, and build predictive models with cutting-edge computational tools.
